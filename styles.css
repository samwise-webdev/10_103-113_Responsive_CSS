/* The Flex Model

    flex-direction: row;
        Main Axis   horizontal           
        Cross Axis  vertical
        (left to right)

    flex-direction: reverse;
        Main Axis   horizontal           
        Cross Axis  vertical
        (right to left) 
        
    flex-direction: column;
        Main Axis   vertical           
        Cross Axis  horizontal
        (top to bottom)  
        
    flex-direction: column-reverse;
        Main Axis   vertical           
        Cross Axis  horizontal
        (bottom to top)

/*Justify Content - determins how the content is distributed across the main axis and is dependent on the main axis direction. so by default it is left to right, but if you did reverse it would go right to left. 

    justify-content: flex-start; (default)
        stacks from the start of the main axis

    justify-content: flex-end;
        stacks from the end of the main axis
    
    justify-content: center;
        stacks the content in the center of the main axis
    
    justify-content: space-between;
        takes all of the extra space and distributes it between the elements, but NOT on the outside edges

    justify-content: space-around;
        gives each element the same amount of space around it
    
    justify-content: space-evenly;
        distribute the extra space so that each element has the same amount of space around it and the edges of the container/parent (depending on axis direction)
*/

/* Flex wrap determins if the contents will wrap onto the next line

    flex-wrap: wrap;
        will allow the content to move onto a new line
            for example, usually flex box will squish the divs so they fit in the container. giving it flex-wrap: wrap; will keep their height and allow multiple lines of content

    flex-wrap: wrap-reverse;
        same but reverse
            example (flex-direction: row;): main axis left to right, cross axis normally top to bottom. wrap-reverse will wrap the items opposite of the way the cross axis is, causing the second row to be above the first

    flex-wrap: nowrap;
        does not allow wrapping
